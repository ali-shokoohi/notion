# notion
Write and keep Good notions.
#### This is just for Gnu/Linux
if you want write and keep the notion(s) and public them later you can use this.
this script keep subtitle, content and taller of your notions.
##### Show, Write, Delete
this script doing:
  1. Show all or some of your written notion(s) of default or arbitrary file.
  2. Write new notions at default or arbitrary file.
  3. Delete all or some of your written notion(s) of default or arbitrary file.
## How to use:
  first you must clone this repository:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/ali-shokoohi/notion.git
  ```
  then Enter the directory:
  ```
  cd notion/
  ```
  and you can see the content of my repository with `ls`
  now i creat a script 'installer.sh' for do somethings , you can view this file and run it:
  ```
  cat installer.sh #For see content of script
  ```
  ```
  chmod +x installer.sh #For runable this script
  ```
  ```
  ./installer.sh #For run script 
  ```
  At end of it. you must give it sudo's password for copy notion in directory /bin
  if you are not in sudo groups you must type this on shell where you are in this directory for use any time.
  ```
  ./notion
  ``` 
  else you can use this command for use this programe any where:
  ```
  notion
  ```
At the moment this script have several small bugs!
